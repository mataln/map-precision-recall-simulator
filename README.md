# map-precision-recall-simulator
A toy markov model that produces plots that look somewhat like the precision-recall curves used to calculate mAP in object detection/instance segmentation. I made this because it was easier than getting zotero to cite some random blog properly. It doesn't simulate the underlying dynamics at all, but the output looks fairly convincing.
